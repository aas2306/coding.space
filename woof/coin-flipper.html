		<p>In this project, you will create an experimental probability calculator. The difference between experimental probability and theoretical probability is subtle but important!</p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>1) Use an online graphics editor (piskelapp.com was used to create graphics for this project) to create a button graphic that the user will click to flip a coin. Upload that graphic and position it somewhere on the screen. </p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>2) Create similar graphics that will sit next to the calculations for the number of heads, number of tails, probability of heads, and probability of tails. It is highly recommended that you create variables to represent things like the space between your buttons, the x values, and y values of each button. To make your buttons line up nicely, reference those variables and use math to define x and y values in terms of each other. </p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>3) Create two text sprites to hold the total number of heads and tails counted so far. Create variables to hold those numbers and have that value display in the text. Start the number at 0.</p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>4) When the flip coin button is pressed, add 1 randomly to the number of heads and tails. Using functions is recommended.</p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>5) Calculate the experimental probability of heads and tails based upon the number of coin flips done so far and update it as the number of flips continues.</p>

	<div class="block">
		<p>6) Create two graphics: one for heads of your coin, and one for tails. Make a sprite appear with the appropriate graphic on each coin flip. You will need a way to alter these sprites later. </p>

		<p>7) Make the first coin that appears appear on the upper left of the screen. Make each coin thereafter appear to the right of the previous one.</p>
